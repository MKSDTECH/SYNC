# Rhino SYNC
## Rhino collaboration

Rhino Sync is an Alpha-stage application developed by MKS DTECH that enables multiple users to collaborate on the same Rhino file with real-time object lock/release and a sync/reload system. 
It supports geometry, block definitions, block instances, layers, and object attributes.

Key Features

- Multi-User Collaboration: Work on the same Rhino file with no fixed limits on users or file size.

- Real-Time Lock/Release: Manage object access to avoid conflicts.

- Sync/Reload Workflow: Keep all users updated with the latest changes.

- Local Network Operation: Requires a shared network drive with good read/write speed.

### This system is under active development, and performance may vary during the Alpha stage.

Rhino Sync Creates .dat files in the same folder as the .3dm file. If you have issue, deleting these files resets collaboration after all users exit collaboration mode.
